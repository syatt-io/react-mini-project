# React Mini Project

Not meant to be an overly difficult or time consuming, this is an opportunity to show us your stuff!

## Directions
- This repo is a fresh create-react-app install, with an added server endpoint that will return a JSON response of products. The endpoint to hit is simply `/api`.
- The goal is to update the homepage with a product listing built from that response.
- A wonderful design is not required, but a clean UX is appreciated.
- There is no correct solution. This will be a basis for conversation about how you went about solving the problems. 
- Aside from the `id` key, you should include all of the data from the response in your UI.

## Some things to note
- Images are intentionally random sizes
- Style out of stock products differently (i.e. inventory being `0`)
- Style `featured` products differently
- Beware of missing or `null` data

## Dev server
`npm start` and visit `http://localhost:3000/`

## Submitting the challenge
Zip up the repo up and email to jobs@syatt.io
